Assignments:

Create a Java program that simulates user registration for an e-commerce application.
The program should allow users to enter their name, email address, password and shipping address.
The program should store the user data in an in-memory data structure, such as an ArrayList or HashMap.
The program should also validate user input to ensure that all required fields are entered and that the email address is in a valid format.
